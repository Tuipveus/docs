## ⚠️️Special Shelly Attention⚠️️

**DO NOT CONNECT ANYTHING TO ANY GPIOs OF THESE DEVICES!!! (No sensors, no switches, nothing) <br>
The GPIOs on the Shelly are connected to AC power!** Only use a Shelly as designed. 

**Do not connect AC power and the serial connection at the same time**
The GND connection of the Shelly is connected to the live AC wire. Connecting serial with your PC will fry your PC.

## Serial Flashing
Shelly 1PM comes with a partially exposed programming/debug header which can be used to flash Tasmota on the device. A USB-to-UART adapter is needed as well as a reliable 3.3V with at least 350 mA drive capability. The following diagram shows the device pinout.

## Template 
```
{"NAME":"Shelly 1PM","GPIO":[56,0,0,0,82,134,0,0,0,0,0,21,0],"FLAG":2,"BASE":18}
```
## Calibration
Tasmota will disable serial logging after a restart as the communication between Tasmota and the Energy Monitoring chip is using the same serial interface. Make sure not to enable `SerialLog` as it will interfere with the Energy Monitoring functionality.

To calibrate the Energy monitoring feature connect a known load and execute the commands shown below. Assumed an AC voltage of 240V, a resistive load of 60W and a line frequency of 50Hz. With a load of 60W the current should be 60W / 240V = 0.25A.
```
FrequencySet 50.000
PowerSet 60.00
VoltageSet 240.0
CurrentSet 250.0
```
Pause a few seconds between executing the commands as the communication between Tasmota and the Energy Monitoring chip is a serial interface which can take over a second to complete.
